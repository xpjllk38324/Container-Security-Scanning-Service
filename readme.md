# Container Security Scanning Service

## Overview
- **Members:** 3-4
- **Complexity:** Complex
- **Size:** Medium

The GitOps process implemented by the framework allows user code to be deployed and run on the Kubernetes (k8s) cluster without any manual checks by the framework administrators. 

## Objectives
This project aims to:
- Model the security threats resulting from the automated deployment process.
- Develop a container vulnerability scanning service that is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline of the framework and its container registry.
- Provide reporting on the results for both developers and administrators.
