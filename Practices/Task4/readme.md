**Interface `Stack`** defines an operation `push` to the stack with a parameter `obj` of type **Element**, an operation `pop` that extracts the top elements of the stack with a return value of type **Element**. Use class diagrams to present the solution.

- **(a)** Add operation `reset` to interface **Stack** without parameters, and a static operation `createNew` that creates and returns a new instance of **Stack**.
- **(b)** Show on the diagram that interface **Stack** depends on class **Element**.
- **(c)** Add class **ListStack**, which implements interface **Stack**. Show operations in the class that implement the interface.
- **(d)** Add a private structural property `arr` of type **Element** into class **ListStack** with multiplicity greater than zero, values of which are sorted in some order and may contain duplicates.
- **(e)** Add a private integer read-only attribute `increment` and a protected operation `resize` to change stack size with integer parameter `newSize`.
- **(f)** Show on a diagram instance **stack** of class **ListStack**, an `arr` property of which contains the first item **first** of type **Element** and **second** as the second item. Set attribute `increment` of the instance **stack** to 10.

An abstract class **Account** has two derived classes: a consumer account **PersonalAccount** and a company account **CompanyAccount**. Use UML2 class diagrams.

- **(a)** Add a class **Person** with a public attribute `FullName` of string type and connect the class with **PersonalAccount** with an association **Owns** with an end `owner` at **Person** and navigable end `account` at **PersonalAccount**.
- **(b)** Using an anonymous association in a similar way, add an **owner** of type **Company** to a **CompanyAccount** and give association ends appropriate names.
- **(c)** Add class **Address** with string attributes `street` and `city` and a positive integer attribute `building`. Using new anonymous associations specify that a **Person** can have a permanent address **registeredAt**, actual address **actual**, while a **Company** could be linked with a legal address **legalAddress** and postal address **postAddress**.

Smart country house **SmartHouse** consists of four walls **Wall** and a roof **Roof**. The house reacts to storm notifications **stormWarning** and hardens the roof with **harden**, closes windows **closeWindows**. All the building materials **Material** have feature `price` and unit weight `unitWeight`.

- **(a)** Add to the model the following materials: red and white bricks **Brick**, wood planks **Plank** made of oak or pine.
- **(b)** Specify that bricks are the material for the walls. Using associations specify that the roof frame **Frame** is made of no more than forty planks and can be of one of these **FrameKind**: triangle roof, plain roof and French (mansard) roof.
- **(c)** A roof frame can be covered with a **Tiling** material, add this to the model.
- **(d)** Suppose we invent a universal building material that substitutes planks, bricks and tiling. Build a country house out of it. How many instances of the material will you need? Explain your answer.

A **Teacher** teaches several courses **CourseOffering**. Use ER diagrams to represent the model.

- **(a)** Using the appropriate type of relation, show that a course consists of a single **Lecture** and several **Practice**.
- **(b)** Specify that a **teacher** gives lectures as a **lecturer** and conducts practice as an **assistant**.
- **(c)** Show that there could be several tasks at the **practice**, each related to some **topic** given at the lecture. At least one **topic** is covered at a **lecture**, but **practice** may exercise no tasks.
- **(d)** Each task given at **practice** has a unique ID, a `text` and a correct `answer`.

Actor **User** interacts with a system **OnlineTranslator** in an abstract use case **Translate**. Use cases **TranslateText** and **TranslateWebPage** detail **Translate**. Show this at a use case diagram.

- **(a)** A use case **TranslateWebPage** includes ¬´include¬ª a use case **SetURL**.
- **(b)** A use case **SetLanguages** extends ¬´extend¬ª another use case **Translate** in an extension point **specifyLanguages**. Extension condition: ‚Äúlanguage is not detected‚Äù.
- **(c)** Add an **ExperiencedUser** actor derived from **User**. An **ExperiencedUser** can interact with the system in a **ProposeTranslation** use case, which details the **TranslateText** use case.

A collector **Cashier** and utility operator **Loader** take care of a vending machine. **Collector** is responsible for money collection **CollectCash** while **operator** replaces water tanks **ChangeWater** and gas **ChangeGas**.

- **(a)** Extract a common **maintenance** use case, which includes authorization in the system and finalization of the maintenance session.
- **(b)** Add that the machine could also be loaded with syrup.
- **(c)** In which case a **collector** could load water tanks in the system? Explain your answer.
- **(d)** Add that a **collector** could monitor the vending machine using a remote video camera over the Internet that is activated by a motion sensor of the building. Justify your solution.
